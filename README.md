# Ask the Client

Project created during Global Legal Hackathon (Warsaw edition) on 6-8th of March 2020.
During two days of hard work, we managed to develop a project called "Ask The Client" - the web app tool dedicated to law offices, helping lawyers to improve their performance by gathering feedback from customers about diffrent legal services. 

Our pitch and demo presentation was awarded by jury with Special Jury Award.
