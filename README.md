# Ask the Client

Project called "Ask The Client" created during Global Legal Hackathon (Warsaw, Poland) on the 6-8th of March 2020.

During two days of hard work, we managed to develop the web app tool dedicated to law offices. The tool helps lawyers to improve their performance by gathering feedback from customers about diffrent legal services. 

Our pitch and demo presentation was awarded by jury with Special Jury Award.
